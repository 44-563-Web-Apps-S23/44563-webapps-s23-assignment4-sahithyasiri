        <h6>TRADITION   George Middleton </h6>
        <p>George Middleton, one of the first to write and publish a volume of
            one-act plays in America, was born in Paterson, New Jersey, 1880. He was
            graduated from Columbia University in 1902.
            OLLIVANT. [_Affectionately._] Glad to be home again, Mary?
            MARY. [_Evasively._] The garden is so pretty.
            OLLIVANT. Hasn't changed much, eh?
            MARY. It seems different; perhaps it's the night.
             OLLIVANT. I guess it isn't up to its usual standard. Haven't seen your
            mother there so often this spring.
            EMILY. [_Quietly._] This dry spell is not good for flowers.
            
            OLLIVANT. It's only the cultivated flowers that need care; can't help
            thinking that when I see the wild ones so hardy in my fields on the
            hill. [_Turning to_ EMILY _and patting her_.] Is there any of that spray
            mixture left, Emily, dear?
            
            EMILY. I haven't looked lately.
            
            OLLIVANT. I'll order some to-morrow. [_Taking up his pipe again and
            looking for the tobacco._] Think it would be a good idea, daughter, if
            you'd spray those rosebushes every couple of weeks. The bugs are a pest
            this spring. Where's my tobacco?
            
            EMILY. On the mantel.
            
            OLLIVANT. Wish you would always leave it on the table; you know how I
            hate to have things changed.
            
                 [OLLIVANT _goes to the mantel, filling his pipe, and while his back
                 is turned_, MARY _makes a quick questioning gesture to her mother,
                 who sighs helplessly_. MARY _ponders a moment_.]
            
            MARY. How's Ben been doing these two years, father?
            
            OLLIVANT. Hasn't your brother written you?
            
            MARY. Only once--when I left home; he disapproved, too.
            
            OLLIVANT. Had an older brother's feeling of wanting to take care of you,
            Mary.
            
            MARY. Yes; I know. How's he doing?
            
            OLLIVANT. He's commencing to get on his feet. Takes time and money for
            any one to get started these days.
            
            MARY. But he's still in partnership with Bert Taylor, isn't he?
            
            OLLIVANT. Yes. He'd have been somewhere if he'd worked in with me as I
            did with _my_ father. Things should be handed down. Offered him the
            chance, tried to make him take it, as your mother knows; but that
            college chum--nice enough fellow, I've heard--turned his head another
            way. [_Lighting his pipe and puffing slowly._] It's best to humor a
            young fellow's ideas if he sticks them out, but I'd like to have had us
            all here together now. The place is big enough even if he should want to
            marry. Your mother and I came here, you know, when your grandfather was
            still alive.
            
            MARY. Then Ben isn't making any money?
            
            OLLIVANT. [_Reluctantly._] Not yet--to speak of.
            
            EMILY. [_Quietly._] But he's promised to pay his father back, Mary.
            
            MARY. I see. [_Thoughtfully._] College and then more help to get
            started, because he's a man.
            
            OLLIVANT. [_Complacently._] He'll have to support a family some day;
            I've had to keep that in mind.
            
            MARY. I'd like to have a real talk with him.
            
            OLLIVANT. When did his letter say he'd be coming for a visit, Emily?
            
            EMILY. The fifteenth.
            
            MARY. Not till then? That's too bad.
            
            OLLIVANT. Eh?
            
            MARY. [_After exchanging a quick glance with her mother and gaining
            courage._] Father, I hope you didn't misunderstand my coming back?
            
            OLLIVANT. Not at all. We all make mistakes--especially when we're young.
            Perhaps I was a bit hasty when you left home, but I knew you'd soon see
            I was right. I didn't think it would take you two years--but perhaps if
            I'd written you before you'd have come sooner. I told your mother I'd
            like to make it easy for you to come home.
            
            MARY. Mother suggested that you write me?
            
            OLLIVANT. Well, I suppose you might put it that way. I always felt she
            thought I was a bit hard on you, but I'm not one to back down easily.
            
            MARY. Don't blame me then, father, if I showed I was your daughter.
            
            OLLIVANT. Let's forget my feeling; but naturally I was set back.
            
            MARY. Because you didn't take my going seriously until I was actually
            leaving.
            
            OLLIVANT. I couldn't get it into my head then, and I can't now, how any
            girl would want to leave a home like this, where you have everything.
            You don't know how lucky you are--or maybe you have realized it. Look
            about you and see what other girls have. Is it like this? Trees,
            flowers, and a lake view that's the best in the county. Why, one can
            breathe here and even taste the air. Every time I come back from a
            business trip it makes a new man of me. Ask your mother. Eh, Emily? When
            I sit out there on the porch in the cool evenings it makes me feel at
            ease with the world to know that the place is _mine_ and that I've
            raised a family and can take care of them all. Ben had to go, I
            suppose--it's the way with sons; but I thought you, at least, would stay
            here, daughter, in this old house where you were born, where I was born,
            where all your early associations----
