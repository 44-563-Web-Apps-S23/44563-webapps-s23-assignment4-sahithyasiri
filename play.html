            <h6>OLLIVANT</h6> <p> [_Affectionately._]</p><p>Glad to be home again, Mary?</p>
           <h6> MARY</h6> <p>[_Evasively._]</p><p>The garden is so pretty.</p>
           <h6>EMILY</h6> <p>[_Softly, as she looks at_ MARY.]</p> <p>I think I understand.</p>
            <h6>OLLIVANT</h6><p>Hasn't changed much, eh?</p>
            <h6>MARY</h6><p>It seems different; perhaps it's the night.</p>
            <h6>OLLIVANT</h6><p>I guess it isn't up to its usual standard. Haven't seen your
            mother there so often this spring.</p>

            <h6>LADY SIMS</h6> <p>[_Much relieved._]</p><p>I think perfect.</p>
            <h6>TOMBES</h6><p>[_Unbending._]</p><p>Especially the females, Sir Harry.</p>
